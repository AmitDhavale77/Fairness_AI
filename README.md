# **Fairness-Aware Model Selection in Machine Learning**  

## **Overview**  
This project is part of the course **Ethics, Fairness, and Explanation in AI (70076)** at **Imperial College London**. The objective is to study **model selection procedures** that consider both **accuracy and fairness** in machine learning models, using the **ACS dataset**.  

## **Assignment Tasks**  
The project consists of three main tasks:  

### **Task 1: Standard ML Model Analysis**  
- Train standard machine learning models such as **logistic regression** and **support vector machines**.  
- Evaluate whether **better generalization** corresponds to a **fairer model**.  
- Perform **train/test** and **train-train/train-val splits** multiple times.  
- Optimize models based on **accuracy** and **fairness** metrics.  

### **Task 2: Fairness-Aware Learning Methods**  
- Implement a **fairness-aware** learning approach (e.g., **pre-processing with fair representations**).  
- Tune **hyperparameters** to balance **accuracy** and **fairness**.  
- Analyze the **accuracy vs. fairness trade-off** across different models.  

### **Task 3: Feature Selection & Deployment Considerations**  
- Select features based on their impact on **fairness and accuracy**.  
- Evaluate models across **different states** using the ACS dataset.  
- Propose a model and feature set for **deployment in a neighboring state**, considering **ethical implications**.  

## **Metrics for Evaluation**  
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Standard classification accuracy measures.  
- **Fairness Metrics**:  
  - **True Positive Rate Difference (TPRD)**  
  - **Positive Rate Parity (PRP)**
